**Description (1 paragraph):**

This website is based on members of the Pittsburgh community coming together to donate tickets for Pittsburgh events to a pool that underserved communities can take advantage of.  Tickets to many wonderful Pittsburgh events; sports, concerts, and family-themed events should be available to many families who are experiencing diminished finances through no fault of their own.  The function of this website is to share tickets with members of their community.  TixShare is dedicated to assisting families in all that Pittsburgh has to offer as friends and neighbors who care.

**APIs (Third-party):**
We will be needing a centralized database.

**Wireframe or design for the website:**
The website was designed by Tracy Torisky and Talita Camargo

**List of tasks or acceptance criteria:**
1. First draft of website design:  
Tracy Torisky/name of website, components for ticket donations & requests, text introducing website

2. First draft of ticket donation component:  Talita Camargo/draft template for individuals to access website and donate tickets to events that go into a database of available tickets

3. First draft of ticket request component:  
Syed Jamil/draft of template for individuals to access website and request tickets to events from database of available tickets

4. First draft of compilation of upcoming Pittsburgh events:  
Yah’Mir McGee/compilation of Pittsburgh events that can be listed on the website for individuals to donate tickets

**What does the functioning prototype have in features for the first week?**

For the first week we have a prototype of the template where individuals can donate tickets to the pool.  
There is a list of upcoming events and a component to indicate how many tickets will be donated.  We will eventually be upgrading the component to allow visitors to input an event, the number of tickets donated, and the eventual database that can be viewed for requests.
